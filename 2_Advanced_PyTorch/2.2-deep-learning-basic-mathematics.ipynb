    "\n",
    "-Supervised learning: Train to obtain an optimal model (this model belongs to a set of functions) through the existing training samples (ie, known data and its corresponding output). Best), and then use this model to map all inputs to corresponding outputs.\n",
    "-Unsupervised learning: The difference between it and supervised learning is that we do not have any training samples in advance, and we need to directly model the data.\n",
    "-Semi-supervised learning: Combine a large amount of unlabeled data and a small amount of labeled data in the training phase. Compared with the model using all label data, the training model using the training set can be more accurate during training.\n",
    "-Reinforcement learning: We set a reward function to confirm whether we are getting closer and closer to the goal. Similar to how we train a pet, we will reward him if we do it right, and we will punish him if we do it wrong. To achieve our training purpose.\n",
    "\n",

    "Linear regression is a statistical analysis method that uses regression analysis in mathematical statistics to determine the quantitative relationship between two or more variables. It is widely used. Its expression is y = w'x+e, where e is a normal distribution whose error follows a mean value of 0.\n",

    "In regression analysis, only one independent variable and one dependent variable are included, and the relationship between the two can be approximated by a straight line. This kind of regression analysis is called unary linear regression analysis. If the regression analysis includes two or more independent variables, and the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variable is linear, it is called multiple linear regression analysis.\n",
