    "## Overview\n",
    "In a biological neural network, each neuron is connected to other neurons. When it is excited, it will send chemicals to the connected neurons, thereby changing the potential in these neurons; if the potential of a neuron exceeds one Threshold, then it will activate, that is, get excited and send chemicals to other neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "In deep learning, this structure is also used for reference. Each neuron (the simple unit mentioned above) accepts input x and transmits it through a connection with weight w. The total input signal is compared with the neuron threshold, and finally passed The activation function process determines whether to activate, and outputs the calculated result y after activation, and what we call training is the weight w inside.\n",

    "## Activation function\n",
    "When introducing neural networks, it was said that neurons will stimulate chemical substances. When it reaches a certain level, neurons will be excited and send information to other neurons. The activation function in the neural network is used to judge whether the information we calculate meets the conditions for later transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why are activation functions non-linear\n",
    "In the calculation process of the neural network, each layer is equivalent to matrix multiplication. No matter how many layers of the neural network, the output is a linear combination of inputs. Even if we have thousands of layers of calculation, it is nothing more than a matrix multiplication and one layer The information obtained by matrix multiplication is not very different, so an activation function is needed to introduce nonlinear factors, so that the neural network can approach any nonlinear function arbitrarily, so that the neural network can be applied to many nonlinear models, adding a neural network The characteristics of model generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early research on neural networks mainly used sigmoid function or tanh function, the output is bounded, and it is easy to serve as the input of the next layer.\n",
    "In recent years, Relu functions and their improved versions (such as Leaky-ReLU, P-ReLU, R-ReLU, etc.) have been widely used in multilayer neural networks due to their simple calculations and good effects.\n",

In the process of neural network back propagation, it is not conducive to the optimization of weights. This problem is called gradient saturation, or gradient dispersion.
