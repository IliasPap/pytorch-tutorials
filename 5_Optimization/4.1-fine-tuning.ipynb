    "# 4.1 Fine tuning model fine tuning\n",
    "In the previous introduction of convolutional neural networks, I said that PyTorch has trained some classic network models for us, so what are these pre-trained models used for? In fact, it is used for our fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.1.1 What is fine-tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "What should I do if I don’t have much training data for a certain task?\n",
    "It doesn't matter, we first find a model trained by others of the same kind, take the ready-made trained model of others, replace it with our own data, adjust the parameters, and train again. This is fine-tune.\n",
    "The classic network models provided in PyTorch are all official Imagenet datasets and trained data. If our data training data is not enough, these data can be used as a basic model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why fine-tune\n",
    "1. For the case where the data set itself is very small (thousands of pictures), it is unrealistic to train a large neural network with tens of millions of parameters from scratch, because the larger the model, the greater the amount of data required, and the overfitting can not avoid. At this time, if you want to use the super feature extraction capabilities of a large neural network, you can only rely on fine-tuning the trained model.\n",
    "2. Training costs can be reduced: If you use the method of exporting feature vectors for migration learning, the later training costs are very low, and the CPU is completely stress-free, and it can be done without a deep learning machine.\n",
    "3. The model trained by the predecessors with a lot of energy will be more powerful than the model you built from scratch in a high probability. There is no need to repeat the wheel.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transfer Learning Transfer Learning\n",
    "Some people always associate transfer learning with neural network training. These two concepts are unrelated at first.\n",
    "Transfer learning is a branch of machine learning. The reason why transfer learning is so closely related to neural networks is that the development of image recognition is too fast and the effect is too good, so almost all transfer learning is in the direction of image recognition, so everyone The transfer learning I have seen is basically based on neural network-related computer vision, and this article will also use this as an example\n",
    "\n",
    "The original intention of migration learning is to save the time of manually labeling samples, so that the model can migrate from an existing labeled data field to an unlabeled data field to train a model suitable for this field. It is too expensive to directly learn the target domain from scratch , We therefore turn to use existing relevant knowledge to assist in learning new knowledge as soon as possible\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple example can illustrate the problem well. What will we learn when we learn programming? Grammar, language-specific API, process processing, object-oriented, design patterns, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax and API are unique to each language, but object-oriented and design patterns are common. We learn JAVA, and then learn C#, or Python. Object-oriented and design patterns don’t have to learn because the principles are Similarly, even when learning C#, you can learn a lot less grammar. This is the concept of transfer learning, which abstracts the unified concept and only learns different content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer learning can be divided into sample-based transfer, feature-based transfer, model-based transfer, and relationship-based transfer according to the learning method, which will not be introduced in detail here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relationship between the two\n",
    "In fact, there is no strict distinction between \"Transfer Learning\" and \"Fine-tune\". The meanings can be interchanged, but the latter seems to be more commonly used to describe the later fine-tuning of transfer learning.\n",
    "My personal understanding is that fine-tuning should be part of transfer learning. Fine tuning can only be said to be a trick."

    "## 4.1.2 How to fine-tune\n",
    "The method of fine-tuning is different for different fields. For example, in the field of speech recognition, the first few layers are generally fine-tuned, and the following layers are fine-tuned for image recognition problems. I can only talk about this reason here.\n",
    "\n",
    "For pictures, the first few layers of our CNN learned are low-level features, such as points, lines, and surfaces. These low-level features can be abstracted out of any picture, so we use him as a general purpose For the data, just fine-tune the high-level features combined by these low-level features. For example, whether these points, lines, and surfaces make up a circle, an ellipse, or a square, the meaning of these representatives is what we need to train later.\n",
    "\n",
    "For voice, each word has the same meaning, but the pronunciation or spelling of the word is different. For example, apple, apple, apfel (German), they all mean the same thing, but the pronunciation and the word It is not the same, but the meaning of it is the same, that is, the high-level features are the same, so we only need to fine-tune the low-level features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following only introduces the fine-tuning of the computer vision direction, taken from [cs231](http://cs231n.github.io/transfer-learning/)\n",
    "\n",
    " -ConvNet as fixed feature extractor.:\n",
    "In fact, there are two approaches:\n",
    "1. Use the features obtained by the fc layer before the last fc layer to learn a linear classifier (such as SVM)\n",
    "2. Retrain the last fc layer\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " -Fine-tuning the ConvNet\n",
    "\n",
    "Fix the parameters of the first few layers, and only fine-tuning the last few layers,\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some fine-tuning tips for the above two schemes. For example, first calculate the feature vector of the convolutional layer of the pre-training model for all training and test data, and then abandon the pre-training model, and only train your own customized simple version full connection The internet.\n",
    "One of the advantages of this method is to save computing resources, each iteration will not run all the data, but just run a simple full connection\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " -Pretrained models\n",
    "\n",
    "This is actually the same as the second one, but it is more extreme. Use the entire pre-trained model as initialization, and then fine-tuning the entire network instead of some layers. However, the amount of calculation for this is very large, which is only equivalent to Do an initialization.\n",

    "## 4.1.3 Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The new data set is similar to the original data set, so you can directly fine-tune a final FC layer or reassign a new classifier\n",
    "2. The new data set is relatively small and the original data set is quite different, so you can start training from the middle of the model, and only fine-tuning the last few layers\n",
    "3. The new data set is relatively small and the original data set is quite different. If the above method still does not work, it is best to retrain, and only use the pre-trained model as the initial data for a new model\n",
    "4. The size of the new data set must be the same as the original data set. For example, the size of the image input in CNN must be the same to avoid an error.\n",
    "5. If the size of the data set is different, you can add a convolution or pool layer before the last fc layer to make the final output consistent with the fc layer, but this will cause a significant decrease in accuracy, so it is not recommended to do this\n",
    "6. Different learning rates can be set for different layers. In general, it is recommended that the learning rate of the layer initialized with the original data used is less than (generally can be set less than 10 times) the initial learning rate, so as to ensure that the The initialized data will not be distorted too fast, and the new layer using the initialized learning rate can converge quickly."
