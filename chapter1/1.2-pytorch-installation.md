# 1.2 Pytorch environment setup
The installation of PyTorch is very simple. According to [PyTorch official website](https://pytorch.org/), you can flexibly choose the system selection and installation method.
Take [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) as an example, briefly talk about the steps and points.


# 1.2.1 Install Pytorch
The installation of pytorch has undergone several changes, please refer to the installation command on the official website. In addition, it should be noted that after version 1.2, pytorch only supports cuda 9.2 and above, so cuda needs to be upgraded. At present, most graphics cards can be used, including the notebook MX250 can also be successfully upgraded to cuda 10.1.

I personally tested using the official website's installation command to install and can't install version 1.3. The reason is unknown (if you have conda installation problems, you can discuss the reasons together), so I suggest you use pip for installation. After testing, pip has no problems.
```bash
#Default use cuda10.1
pip3 install torch === 1.3.0 torchvision === 0.4.1 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.

#cuda 9.2
pip3 install torch == 1.3.0 + cu92 torchvision == 0.4.1 + cu92 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html

#cpuversion
pip3 install torch == 1.3.0 + cpu torchvision == 0.4.1 + cpu -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```


Verify input python enter
```python
import torch
torch .__ version__
# Get the result '1.3.0'
```

## 1.2.2 Configure Jupyter Notebook
The newly created environment is not installed and installed ipykernel, so it can not be registered in Jupyter Notebook, so first prepare the environment
```bash
#Install ipykernel
conda install ipykernel
#Write environment
python -m ipykernel install --name pytorch --display-name "Pytorch for Deeplearning"
```
The next step is to customize the Jupyter Notebook
```bash
#Switch back to the basic environment
activate base
#Create jupyter notebook configuration file
jupyter notebook --generate-config
## Here will show the specific location to create jupyter_notebook_config.py
```
Open file, modify
```
c.NotebookApp.notebook_dir = '' default directory location
c.NotebookApp.iopub_data_rate_limit = 100000000 This is changed to be larger or it may report an error
```

## 1.2.3 Test
At this point, the installation of Pytorch's development environment is complete. You can open Jupyter Notebook in the start menu and select `Pytorch for Deeplearning` when creating files in the New menu. Create a PyTorch related development environment.

## 1.2.4 Problem solving

### Question 1: Error code when starting python

Delete .python_history [source](http://tantai.org/posts/install-keras-pytorch-jupyter-notebook-Anaconda-window-10-cpu/)
### Question 2 The default directory setting is not effective
Open the shortcut to see if the shortcut is the same as this screenshot. If yes, delete `% USERPROFILE%`. Changing the parameter will overwrite the notebook_dir setting, causing the configuration to be ineffective
