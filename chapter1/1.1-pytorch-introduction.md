# 1.1 Introduction to Pytorch

** Torch English to Chinese: Torch **

    A Tensor library like Numpy, unlike Numpy it has strong GPU support. Lua is a wrapper for Torch (Yes! You need to have a good understanding of Lua), and for that you will need LuaRocks package manager.
[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44371560/what-is-the-relationship-between-pytorch-and-torch)

Torch is a Tensor operation library similar to Numpy. Unlike Numpy, Torch supports GPU well. Lua is Torch's upper packaging.

    Torch is not going anywhere. PyTorch and Torch use the same C libraries that contain all the performance: TH, THC, THNN, THCUNN and they will continue to be shared.
    We still and will have continued engineering on Torch itself, and we have no immediate plan to remove that.

PyTorch and Torch use C libraries containing all the same performance: TH, THC, THNN, THCUNN, and they will continue to share these libraries.

This answer is very clear, in fact, PyTorch and Torch both use the same bottom layer, but use different upper packaging languages.

Note: Although LUA is fast, it is too niche, so PyTorch will appear.

## 1.1.3 Reintroducing PyTorch
    PyTorch is an open source machine learning library for Python, based on Torch, used for applications such as natural language processing. It is primarily developed by Facebook's artificial-intelligence research group, and Uber's "Pyro" software for probabilistic programming is built on it.

PyTorch is a Torch-based Python open source machine learning library for applications such as natural language processing. It was mainly developed by Facebook's artificial intelligence research group. Uber's "Pyro" is also the library used.

    PyTorch is a Python package that provides two high-level features:

        Tensor computation (like NumPy) with strong GPU acceleration

        Deep neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system
    You can reuse your favorite Python packages such as NumPy, SciPy and Cython to extend PyTorch when needed.

PyTorch is a Python package that provides two advanced features:
* Tensor calculation with powerful GPU acceleration (eg NumPy)
* Deep neural network with automatic derivation system

## 1.1.4 Compare PyTorch and Tensorflow
There is no good framework, only a suitable framework. [This article](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/28636490) has a simple comparison, so I wo n’t go into details here.
And the technology is developed, and the comparison is not absolute. For example, Tensorflow introduced the Eager Execution mechanism to implement dynamic graphs in version 1.5, PyTorch visualization, windows support, and tensor flips along the dimension have all been issues. Not a problem.

## 1.1.5 Summary again

-PyTorch is a very simple, elegant, efficient and fast framework
-The design pursues the least package, and try to avoid re-creating wheels
-It is the most elegant object-oriented design in all frameworks, and the design is most in line with people's thinking. It allows users to focus on implementing their own ideas as much as possible.
-Big guy support, similar to Google ’s Tensorflow, FAIR support is enough to ensure PyTorch gets continuous development updates
-Good documentation (compared to other FB projects, PyTorch's documentation is almost perfect, refer to Thrift), a forum personally maintained by PyTorch authors for users to communicate and ask questions
-Easy to get started

So if the above information has something that appeals to you, then be sure to finish reading this book :)
